# CCNA-Networking-Project
This was my final project for the Netacad course at Northampton Community College. It includes parts from all the basic subjects covered in the CCNA exam including:
   * NTP 
   * IPv4 over IPv6 GRE tunnel to a remote site over a simulated WAN cloud connection
   * DHCP
   * NAT/PAT
   * OSPF
   * Static routing
   * An ACL that limits access to the VTY lines and an ACL that blocks external pings into the private network
   * SSH 
   * RPVST+
   * Etherchannel
   * VLAN configuration and interVLAN routing
   * Switchport configuration according to best practices including using switchport security, portfast/loopguard/rootguard/bpdufilter, assigning unused          ports to an unused VLAN, etc
  
Configurations have been edited for brevity.
